# SQL-Project
 Hi, I'm IKEDIASHI AMAECHI STEPHEN â€“ Data Analyst
Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a data analyst passionate about transforming raw data into actionable insights. My work focuses on data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA) and interactive dashboards using tools like SQL, Power BI, and Excel.

Crime Analysis in Los Angeles
Objective
As a member of the Analytics Division, you are aware that there are numerous questions that must be answered utilizing CID data. However, this data is not organized and is simply exported as flat files that can only be viewed if there are problems! You must create a pipeline to organize and manage this data using a SQL database to make it much easier to answer inquiries in the future. Then, using the data, react to the questions and write a detailed report for the authorities to utilize in taking action against crimes in Los Angeles.
